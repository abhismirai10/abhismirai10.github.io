I am a recent Masterâ€™s graduate in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in **Robotics and Automation**, at Florida Institute of Technology. Advised by [Dr. Ryan White](https://www.fit.edu/faculty-profiles/w/white-ryan/), My master's research focuses on bridging the gap between classical robotics control and modern learning-based techniques, leveraging **imitation learning and reinforcement learning** for robotic manipulation. Specifically, I explored **Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT), Diffusion Policies and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, achieving high success rates in dynamic manipulation tasks and conducting a comparative analysis between traditional control methods and AI-driven approaches to enhance robotic adaptability and efficiency. Please visit [Research](/research/) for more details.

Recently, I have worked on impactful robotics projects:

At [KSCIA](https://www.kscia.com/), Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, I worked as a Robotics Project Developer Intern, developing interactive robotics projects for educational purposes. I designed and programmed a functional model of **NASAâ€™s Perseverance Rover**, to educate visitors about space robotics.

At [Jaycon Systems](https://www.jaycon.com/), I contributed to the development of an **Augmented Reality (AR) glasses**, applying my expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and hardware integration to enhance real-time object recognition and tracking.

My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of robotics through innovative solutions, combining **Mechanical Design, AI, and Robotics** to create impactful technologies.
