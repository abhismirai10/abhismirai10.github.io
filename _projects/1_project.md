## Overview
As a **Robotics Project Developer Intern** at **Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex**, I designed and built a functional model of **NASA’s Perseverance Rover** to provide an engaging educational experience for visitors. This project integrated **mechanical design, embedded systems, and motion planning** to simulate real rover functionalities.

### **Key Features & Technologies**
- **Mechanical Design**: Created a **Fusion 360** CAD model replicating NASA’s Perseverance Rover.
- **Embedded Systems**: Utilized **Raspberry Pi** and **STM32 microcontroller** for control and automation.
- **Software & Control**:
  - Implemented **ROS (Robot Operating System)** for real-time mobility and control.
  - Developed **PID control algorithms** for precise navigation.
  - Designed **motion planning frameworks** for autonomous operations.
- **Hardware Integration**:
  - Connected **IMUs, ultrasonic sensors, and camera modules** for interactive features.
  - Programmed real-time motion control using **C and C++**.

### **Project Impact**
The model successfully engaged **students and visitors**, offering an immersive learning experience about **Mars rovers, space robotics, and autonomous navigation**. The integration of **motion planning and real-time control** made it an effective educational tool.
